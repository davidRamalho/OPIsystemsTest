# OPIsystems Take Home Test

This test actually ended up being a lot of fun. If I had more time I would have liked to add some more features such as interactive tables with the ability to sort and/or hide data. Also, I would have liked to complete some unit testing on the features already built and improved on the styling. 

One of the biggest challenges was getting the timezone settings and date manipulation to work as intended.
